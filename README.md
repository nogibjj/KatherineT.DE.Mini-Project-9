# Data Engineering Mini Project 9
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook and perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset. I used Google Colab to accomplish this task. The dataset used here is the cereal dataset, which contains statistics of different cereal brands, including calories, ratings, weight, etc.
